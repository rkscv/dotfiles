--- Run the given command. This is similar to the commands used in input.conf. See
--- [List of Input Commands](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#list-of-input-commands).
---
--- By default, this will show something on the OSD (depending on the command), as
--- if it was used in `input.conf`. See
--- [Input Command Prefixes](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#input-command-prefixes)
--- how to influence OSD usage per command.
---
--- Returns `true` on success, or `nil, error` on error.
function mp.command(string) end

--- Similar to `mp.command`, but pass each command argument as separate parameter.
--- This has the advantage that you don't have to care about quoting and escaping in
--- some cases.
---
--- Example:
---
--- ```
--- mp.command("loadfile " .. filename .. " append")
--- mp.commandv("loadfile", filename, "append")
--- ```
---
--- These two commands are equivalent, except that the first version breaks if the
--- filename contains spaces or certain special characters.
---
--- Note that properties are *not* expanded. You can use either `mp.command`, the
--- `expand-properties` prefix, or the `mp.get_property` family of functions.
---
--- Unlike `mp.command`, this will not use OSD by default either (except for some
--- OSD-specific commands).
function mp.commandv(arg1, arg2, ...) end

--- Similar to `mp.commandv`, but pass the argument list as table. This has the
--- advantage that in at least some cases, arguments can be passed as native types.
--- It also allows you to use named argument.
---
--- If the table is an array, each array item is like an argument in `mp.commandv()`
--- (but can be a native type instead of a string).
---
--- If the table contains string keys, it's interpreted as command with named
--- arguments. This requires at least an entry with the key `name` to be present,
--- which must be a string, and contains the command name. The special entry
--- `_flags` is optional, and if present, must be an array of
--- [Input Command Prefixes](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#input-command-prefixes)
--- to apply. All other entries are interpreted as arguments.
---
--- Returns a result table on success (usually empty), or `def, error` on error.
--- `def` is the second parameter provided to the function, and is nil if it's
--- missing.
function mp.command_native(table, def) end

--- Like `mp.command_native()`, but the command is ran asynchronously (as far as
--- possible), and upon completion, fn is called. fn has three arguments:
--- `fn(success, result, error)`:
---
--- - `success`: Always a Boolean and is true if the command was successful,
---   otherwise false.
--- - `result`: The result value (can be nil) in case of success, nil otherwise (as
---   returned by `mp.command_native()`).
--- - `error`: The error string in case of an error, nil otherwise.
---
--- Returns a table with undefined contents, which can be used as argument for
--- `mp.abort_async_command`.
---
--- If starting the command failed for some reason, `nil, error` is returned, and
--- `fn` is called indicating failure, using the same error value.
---
--- `fn` is always called asynchronously, even if the command failed to start.
function mp.command_native_async(table, fn) end

--- Abort a `mp.command_native_async` call. The argument is the return value of that
--- command (which starts asynchronous execution of the command). Whether this works
--- and how long it takes depends on the command and the situation. The abort call
--- itself is asynchronous. Does not return anything.
function mp.abort_async_command(t) end

--- Delete the given property. See `mp.get_property` and
--- [Properties](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#properties) for more information
--- about properties. Most properties cannot be deleted.
---
--- Returns true on success, or `nil, error` on error.
function mp.del_property(name) end

--- Return the value of the given property as string. These are the same properties
--- as used in input.conf. See
--- [Properties](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#properties) for a list of properties.
--- The returned string is formatted similar to `${=name}` (see
--- [Property Expansion](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#property-expansion)).
---
--- Returns the string on success, or `def, error` on error. `def` is the second
--- parameter provided to the function, and is nil if it's missing.
function mp.get_property(name, def) end

--- Similar to `mp.get_property`, but return the property value formatted for OSD.
--- This is the same string as printed with `${name}` when used in input.conf.
---
--- Returns the string on success, or `def, error` on error. `def` is the second
--- parameter provided to the function, and is an empty string if it's missing.
--- Unlike `get_property()`, assigning the return value to a variable will always
--- result in a string.
function mp.get_property_osd(name, def) end

--- Similar to `mp.get_property`, but return the property value as Boolean.
---
--- Returns a Boolean on success, or `def, error` on error.
function mp.get_property_bool(name, def) end

--- Similar to `mp.get_property`, but return the property value as number.
---
--- Note that while Lua does not distinguish between integers and floats, mpv
--- internals do. This function simply request a double float from mpv, and mpv will
--- usually convert integer property values to float.
---
--- Returns a number on success, or `def, error` on error.
function mp.get_property_number(name, def) end

--- Similar to `mp.get_property`, but return the property value using the best Lua
--- type for the property. Most time, this will return a string, Boolean, or number.
--- Some properties (for example `chapter-list`) are returned as tables.
---
--- Returns a value on success, or `def, error` on error. Note that `nil` might be a
--- possible, valid value too in some corner cases.
function mp.get_property_native(name, def) end

--- Set the given property to the given string value. See `mp.get_property` and
--- [Properties](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#properties) for more information
--- about properties.
---
--- Returns true on success, or `nil, error` on error.
function mp.set_property(name, value) end

--- Similar to `mp.set_property`, but set the given property to the given Boolean
--- value.
function mp.set_property_bool(name, value) end

--- Similar to `mp.set_property`, but set the given property to the given numeric
--- value.
---
--- Note that while Lua does not distinguish between integers and floats, mpv
--- internals do. This function will test whether the number can be represented as
--- integer, and if so, it will pass an integer value to mpv, otherwise a double
--- float.
function mp.set_property_number(name, value) end

--- Similar to `mp.set_property`, but set the given property using its native type.
---
--- Since there are several data types which cannot represented natively in Lua,
--- this might not always work as expected. For example, while the Lua wrapper can
--- do some guesswork to decide whether a Lua table is an array or a map, this would
--- fail with empty tables. Also, there are not many properties for which it makes
--- sense to use this, instead of `set_property`, `set_property_bool`,
--- `set_property_number`. For these reasons, this function should probably be
--- avoided for now, except for properties that use tables natively.
function mp.set_property_native(name, value) end

--- Return the current mpv internal time in seconds as a number. This is basically
--- the system time, with an arbitrary offset.
function mp.get_time() end

--- Register callback to be run on a key binding. The binding will be mapped to the
--- given `key`, which is a string describing the physical key. This uses the same
--- key names as in input.conf, and also allows combinations (e.g. `ctrl+a`). If the
--- key is empty or `nil`, no physical key is registered, but the user still can
--- create own bindings (see below).
---
--- After calling this function, key presses will cause the function `fn` to be
--- called (unless the user remapped the key with another binding). However, if the
--- key binding is canceled , the function will not be called, unless `complex` flag
--- is set to `true`, where the function will be called with the `canceled` entry
--- set to `true`.
---
--- For example, a canceled key binding can happen in the following situations:
---
--- - If key A is pressed while key B is being held down, key B is logically
---   released ("canceled" by key A), which stops the current autorepeat action key
---   B has.
--- - If key A is pressed while a mouse button is being held down, the mouse button
---   is logically released, but the mouse button's action will not be called,
---   unless `complex` flag is set to `true`.
---
--- The `name` argument should be a short symbolic string. It allows the user to
--- remap the key binding via input.conf using the `script-message` command, and the
--- name of the key binding (see below for an example). The name should be unique
--- across other bindings in the same script - if not, the previous binding with the
--- same name will be overwritten. You can omit the name, in which case a random
--- name is generated internally. (Omitting works as follows: either pass `nil` for
--- `name`, or pass the `fn` argument in place of the name. The latter is not
--- recommended and is handled for compatibility only.)
---
--- The `flags` argument is used for optional parameters. This is a table, which can
--- have the following entries:
---
--- - `repeatable`: If set to `true`, enables key repeat for this specific binding.
---   This option only makes sense when `complex` is not set to `true`.
---
--- - `scalable`: If set to `true`, enables key scaling for this specific binding.
---   This option only makes sense when `complex` is set to `true`. Note that this
---   has no effect if the key binding is invoked by `script-binding` command, where
---   the scalability of the command takes precedence.
---
--- - `complex`: If set to `true`, then `fn` is called on key down, repeat and up
---   events, with the first argument being a table. This table has the following
---   entries (and may contain undocumented ones):
---
---   - `event`: Set to one of the strings `down`, `repeat`, `up` or `press` (the
---     latter if key up/down/repeat can't be tracked), which indicates the key's
---     logical state.
---   - `is_mouse`: Boolean: Whether the event was caused by a mouse button.
---   - `canceled`: Boolean: Whether the event was canceled. Not all types of
---     cancellations set this flag.
---   - `key_name`: The name of they key that triggered this, or `nil` if invoked
---     artificially. If the key name is unknown, it's an empty string.
---   - `key_text`: Text if triggered by a text key, otherwise `nil`. See
---     description of `script-binding` command for details (this field is
---     equivalent to the 5th argument).
---   - `scale`: The scale of the key, such as the ones produced by `WHEEL_*` keys.
---     The scale is 1 if the key is nonscalable.
---   - `arg`: User-provided string in the `arg` argument in the `script-binding`
---     command if the key binding is invoked by that command.
---
--- Internally, key bindings are dispatched via the `script-message-to` or
--- `script-binding` input commands and `mp.register_script_message`.
---
--- Trying to map multiple commands to a key will essentially prefer a random
--- binding, while the other bindings are not called. It is guaranteed that user
--- defined bindings in the central input.conf are preferred over bindings added
--- with this function (but see `mp.add_forced_key_binding`).
---
--- Example:
---
--- ```
--- function something_handler()
---     print("the key was pressed")
--- end
--- mp.add_key_binding("x", "something", something_handler)
--- ```
---
--- This will print the message `the key was pressed` when `x` was pressed.
---
--- The user can remap these key bindings. Then the user has to put the following
--- into their input.conf to remap the command to the `y` key:
---
--- ```text
--- y script-binding something
--- ```
---
--- This will print the message when the key `y` is pressed. (`x` will still work,
--- unless the user remaps it.)
---
--- You can also explicitly send a message to a named script only. Assume the above
--- script was using the filename `fooscript.lua`:
---
--- ```text
--- y script-binding fooscript/something
--- ```
function mp.add_key_binding(key, name, fn, flags) end

--- This works almost the same as `mp.add_key_binding`, but registers the key
--- binding in a way that will overwrite the user's custom bindings in their
--- input.conf. (`mp.add_key_binding` overwrites default key bindings only, but not
--- those by the user's input.conf.)
function mp.add_forced_key_binding(...) end

--- Remove a key binding added with `mp.add_key_binding` or
--- `mp.add_forced_key_binding`. Use the same name as you used when adding the
--- bindings. It's not possible to remove bindings for which you omitted the name.
function mp.remove_key_binding(name) end

--- Call a specific function when an event happens. The event name is a string, and
--- the function fn is a Lua function value.
---
--- Some events have associated data. This is put into a Lua table and passed as
--- argument to fn. The Lua table by default contains a `name` field, which is a
--- string containing the event name. If the event has an error associated, the
--- `error` field is set to a string describing the error, on success it's not set.
---
--- If multiple functions are registered for the same event, they are run in
--- registration order, which the first registered function running before all the
--- other ones.
---
--- Returns true if such an event exists, false otherwise.
---
--- See [Events](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#events) and
--- [List of events](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#list-of-events) for details.
function mp.register_event(name, fn) end

--- Undo `mp.register_event(..., fn)`. This removes all event handlers that are
--- equal to the `fn` parameter. This uses normal Lua `==` comparison, so be careful
--- when dealing with closures.
function mp.unregister_event(fn) end

--- Watch a property for changes. If the property `name` is changed, then the
--- function `fn(name)` will be called. `type` can be `nil`, or be set to one of
--- `none`, `native`, `bool`, `string`, or `number`. `none` is the same as `nil`.
--- For all other values, the new value of the property will be passed as second
--- argument to `fn`, using `mp.get_property_<type>` to retrieve it. This means if
--- `type` is for example `string`, `fn` is roughly called as in
--- `fn(name, mp.get_property_string(name))`.
---
--- If possible, change events are coalesced. If a property is changed a bunch of
--- times in a row, only the last change triggers the change function. (The exact
--- behavior depends on timing and other things.)
---
--- If a property is unavailable, or on error, the value argument to `fn` is `nil`.
--- (The `observe_property()` call always succeeds, even if a property does not
--- exist.)
---
--- In some cases the function is not called even if the property changes. This
--- depends on the property, and it's a valid feature request to ask for better
--- update handling of a specific property.
---
--- If the `type` is `none` or `nil`, the change function `fn` will be called
--- sporadically even if the property doesn't actually change. You should therefore
--- avoid using these types.
---
--- You always get an initial change notification. This is meant to initialize the
--- user's state to the current value of the property.
function mp.observe_property(name, type, fn) end

--- Undo `mp.observe_property(..., fn)`. This removes all property handlers that are
--- equal to the `fn` parameter. This uses normal Lua `==` comparison, so be careful
--- when dealing with closures.
function mp.unobserve_property(fn) end

--- Call the given function fn when the given number of seconds has elapsed. Note
--- that the number of seconds can be fractional. For now, the timer's resolution
--- may be as low as 50 ms, although this will be improved in the future.
---
--- If the `disabled` argument is set to `true` or a truthy value, the timer will
--- wait to be manually started with a call to its `resume()` method.
---
--- This is a one-shot timer: it will be removed when it's fired.
---
--- Returns a timer object. See `mp.add_periodic_timer` for details.
function mp.add_timeout(seconds, fn, disabled) end

--- Call the given function periodically. This is like `mp.add_timeout`, but the
--- timer is re-added after the function fn is run.
---
--- Returns a timer object. The timer object provides the following methods:
---
--- - `stop()`: Disable the timer. Does nothing if the timer is already disabled.
---   This will remember the current elapsed time when stopping, so that `resume()`
---   essentially unpauses the timer.
--- - `kill()`: Disable the timer. Resets the elapsed time. `resume()` will restart
---   the timer.
--- - `resume()`: Restart the timer. If the timer was disabled with `stop()`, this
---   will resume at the time it was stopped. If the timer was disabled with
---   `kill()`, or if it's a previously fired one-shot timer (added with
---   `add_timeout()`), this starts the timer from the beginning, using the
---   initially configured timeout.
--- - `is_enabled()`: Whether the timer is currently enabled or was previously
---   disabled (e.g. by `stop()` or `kill()`).
--- - `timeout` (RW): This field contains the current timeout period. This value is
---   not updated as time progresses. It's only used to calculate when the timer
---   should fire next when the timer expires. If you write this, you can call
---   `t:kill() ; t:resume()` to reset the current timeout to the new one.
---   (`t:stop()` won't use the new timeout.)
--- - `oneshot` (RW): Whether the timer is periodic (`false`) or fires just once
---   (`true`). This value is used when the timer expires (but before the timer
---   callback function fn is run).
---
--- Note that these are methods, and you have to call them using `:` instead of `.`
--- (Refer to <https://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#3.4.9> .)
---
--- Example:
---
--- ```
--- seconds = 0
--- timer = mp.add_periodic_timer(1, function()
---     print("called every second")
---     -- stop it after 10 seconds
---     seconds = seconds + 1
---     if seconds >= 10 then
---         timer:kill()
---     end
--- end)
--- ```
function mp.add_periodic_timer(seconds, fn, disabled) end

--- Return a setting from the `--script-opts` option. It's up to the user and the
--- script how this mechanism is used. Currently, all scripts can access this
--- equally, so you should be careful about collisions.
function mp.get_opt(key) end

--- Return the name of the current script. The name is usually made of the filename
--- of the script, with directory and file extension removed. If there are several
--- scripts which would have the same name, it's made unique by appending a number.
--- Any nonalphanumeric characters are replaced with `_`.
---
--- Example: The script `/path/to/foo-script.lua` becomes `foo_script`.
function mp.get_script_name() end

--- Return the directory if this is a script packaged as directory (see
--- [Script location](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#script-location) for a
--- description). Return nothing if this is a single file script.
function mp.get_script_directory() end

--- Show an OSD message on the screen. `duration` is in seconds, and is optional
--- (uses `--osd-duration` by default).
function mp.osd_message(text, duration) end

--- Calls `mpv_get_wakeup_pipe()` and returns the read end of the wakeup pipe. This
--- is deprecated, but still works. (See `client.h` for details.)
function mp.get_wakeup_pipe() end

--- Return the relative time in seconds when the next timer (`mp.add_timeout` and
--- similar) expires. If there is no timer, return `nil`.
function mp.get_next_timeout() end

--- This can be used to run custom event loops. If you want to have direct control
--- what the Lua script does (instead of being called by the default event loop),
--- you can set the global variable `mp_event_loop` to your own function running the
--- event loop. From your event loop, you should call `mp.dispatch_events()` to
--- dequeue and dispatch mpv events.
---
--- If the `allow_wait` parameter is set to `true`, the function will block until
--- the next event is received or the next timer expires. Otherwise (and this is the
--- default behavior), it returns as soon as the event loop is emptied. It's
--- strongly recommended to use `mp.get_next_timeout()` and `mp.get_wakeup_pipe()`
--- if you're interested in properly working notification of new events and working
--- timers.
function mp.dispatch_events(allow_wait) end

--- Register an event loop idle handler. Idle handlers are called before the script
--- goes to sleep after handling all new events. This can be used for example to
--- delay processing of property change events: if you're observing multiple
--- properties at once, you might not want to act on each property change, but only
--- when all change notifications have been received.
function mp.register_idle(fn) end

--- Undo `mp.register_idle(fn)`. This removes all idle handlers that are equal to
--- the `fn` parameter. This uses normal Lua `==` comparison, so be careful when
--- dealing with closures.
function mp.unregister_idle(fn) end

--- Set the minimum log level of which mpv message output to receive. These messages
--- are normally printed to the terminal. By calling this function, you can set the
--- minimum log level of messages which should be received with the `log-message`
--- event. See the description of this event for details. The level is a string, see
--- `msg.log` for allowed log levels.
function mp.enable_messages(level) end

--- This is a helper to dispatch `script-message` or `script-message-to` invocations
--- to Lua functions. `fn` is called if `script-message` or `script-message-to`
--- (with this script as destination) is run with `name` as first parameter. The
--- other parameters are passed to `fn`. If a message with the given name is already
--- registered, it's overwritten.
---
--- Used by `mp.add_key_binding`, so be careful about name collisions.
function mp.register_script_message(name, fn) end

--- Undo a previous registration with `mp.register_script_message`. Does nothing if
--- the `name` wasn't registered.
function mp.unregister_script_message(name) end

--- Create an OSD overlay. This is a very thin wrapper around the `osd-overlay`
--- command. The function returns a table, which mostly contains fields that will be
--- passed to `osd-overlay`. The `format` parameter is used to initialize the
--- `format` field. The `data` field contains the text to be used as overlay. For
--- details, see the `osd-overlay` command.
---
--- In addition, it provides the following methods:
---
--- - `update()`: Commit the OSD overlay to the screen, or in other words, run the
---   `osd-overlay` command with the current fields of the overlay table. Returns
---   the result of the `osd-overlay` command itself.
--- - `remove()`: Remove the overlay from the screen. A `update()` call will add it
---   again.
---
--- Example:
---
--- ```
--- ov = mp.create_osd_overlay("ass-events")
--- ov.data = "{\\an5}{\\b1}hello world!"
--- ov:update()
--- ```
---
--- The advantage of using this wrapper (as opposed to running `osd-overlay`
--- directly) is that the `id` field is allocated automatically.
function mp.create_osd_overlay(format) end

--- Returns a tuple of `osd_width, osd_height, osd_par`. The first two give the size
--- of the OSD in pixels (for video outputs like `--vo=xv`, this may be "scaled"
--- pixels). The third is the display pixel aspect ratio.
---
--- May return invalid/nonsense values if OSD is not initialized yet.
function mp.get_osd_size() end

--- Make the script exit at the end of the current event loop iteration. This does
--- not terminate mpv itself or other scripts.
---
--- This can be polyfilled to support mpv versions older than 0.40 with:
---
--- ```
--- if not _G.exit then
---     function exit()
---         mp.keep_running = false
---     end
--- end
--- ```
function exit() end

--- Add a hook callback for `type` (a string identifying a certain kind of hook).
--- These hooks allow the player to call script functions and wait for their result
--- (normally, the Lua scripting interface is asynchronous from the point of view of
--- the player core). `priority` is an arbitrary integer that allows ordering among
--- hooks of the same kind. Using the value 50 is recommended as neutral default
--- value.
---
--- `fn(hook)` is the function that will be called during execution of the hook. The
--- parameter passed to it (`hook`) is a Lua object that can control further aspects
--- about the currently invoked hook. It provides the following methods:
---
--- - `defer()`: Returning from the hook function should not automatically continue
---   the hook. Instead, the API user wants to call `hook:cont()` on its own at a
---   later point in time (before or after the function has returned).
--- - `cont()`: Continue the hook. Doesn't need to be called unless `defer()` was
---   called.
---
--- See [Hooks](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#hooks) for currently existing hooks
--- and what they do - only the hook list is interesting; handling hook execution is
--- done by the Lua script function automatically.
function mp.add_hook(type, priority, fn) end

return mp
