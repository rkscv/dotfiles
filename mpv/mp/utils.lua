local utils = {}

--- Returns the directory that mpv was launched from. On error, `nil, error` is
--- returned.
function utils.getcwd() end

--- Enumerate all entries at the given path on the filesystem, and return them as
--- array. Each entry is a directory entry (without the path). The list is unsorted
--- (in whatever order the operating system returns it).
---
--- If the `filter` argument is given, it must be one of the following strings:
---
--- - `files`: List regular files only. This excludes directories, special files
---   (like UNIX device files or FIFOs), and dead symlinks. It includes UNIX
---   symlinks to regular files.
--- - `dirs`: List directories only, or symlinks to directories. `.` and `..` are
---   not included.
--- - `normal`: Include the results of both `files` and `dirs`. (This is the
---   default.)
--- - `all`: List all entries, even device files, dead symlinks, FIFOs, and the `.`
---   and `..` entries.
---
--- On error, `nil, error` is returned.
function utils.readdir(path, filter) end

--- Stats the given path for information and returns a table with the following
--- entries:
---
--- - `mode`: protection bits (on Windows, always 755 (octal) for directories and
---   644 (octal) for files)
--- - `size`: size in bytes
--- - `atime`: time of last access
--- - `mtime`: time of last modification
--- - `ctime`: time of last metadata change
--- - `is_file`: Whether `path` is a regular file (boolean)
--- - `is_dir`: Whether `path` is a directory (boolean)
---
--- `mode` and `size` are integers. Timestamps (`atime`, `mtime` and `ctime`) are
--- integer seconds since the Unix epoch (Unix time). The booleans `is_file` and
--- `is_dir` are provided as a convenience; they can be and are derived from `mode`.
---
--- On error (e.g. path does not exist), `nil, error` is returned.
function utils.file_info(path) end

--- Split a path into directory component and filename component, and return them.
--- The first return value is always the directory. The second return value is the
--- trailing part of the path, the directory entry.
function utils.split_path(path) end

--- Return the concatenation of the 2 paths. Tries to be clever. For example, if
--- `p2` is an absolute path, `p2` is returned without change.
function utils.join_path(p1, p2) end

--- Runs an external process and waits until it exits. Returns process status and
--- the captured output. This is a legacy wrapper around calling the `subprocess`
--- command with `mp.command_native`. It does the following things:
---
--- - copy the table `t`
--- - rename `cancellable` field to `playback_only`
--- - rename `max_size` to `capture_size`
--- - set `capture_stdout` field to `true` if unset
--- - set `name` field to `subprocess`
--- - call `mp.command_native(copied_t)`
--- - if the command failed, create a dummy result table
--- - copy `error_string` to `error` field if the string is non-empty
--- - return the result table
---
--- It is recommended to use `mp.command_native` or `mp.command_native_async`
--- directly, instead of calling this legacy wrapper. It is for compatibility only.
---
--- See the `subprocess` documentation for semantics and further parameters.
function utils.subprocess(t) end

--- Runs an external process and detaches it from mpv's control.
---
--- The parameter `t` is a table. The function reads the following entries:
---
--- - `args`: Array of strings of the same semantics as the `args` used in the
---   `subprocess` function.
---
--- The function returns `nil`.
---
--- This is a legacy wrapper around calling the `run` command with `mp.commandv` and
--- other functions.
function utils.subprocess_detached(t) end

--- Returns the process ID of the running mpv process. This can be used to identify
--- the calling mpv when launching (detached) subprocesses.
function utils.getpid() end

--- Returns the C environment as a list of strings. (Do not confuse this with the
--- Lua "environment", which is an unrelated concept.)
function utils.get_env_list() end

--- Parses the given string argument as JSON, and returns it as a Lua table. On
--- error, returns `nil, error`. (Currently, `error` is just a string reading
--- `error`, because there is no fine-grained error reporting of any kind.)
---
--- The returned value uses similar conventions as `mp.get_property_native()` to
--- distinguish empty objects and arrays.
---
--- If the `trail` parameter is `true` (or any value equal to `true`), then trailing
--- non-whitespace text is tolerated by the function, and the trailing text is
--- returned as 3rd return value. (The 3rd return value is always there, but with
--- `trail` set, no error is raised.)
function utils.parse_json(str, trail) end

--- Format the given Lua table (or value) as a JSON string and return it. On error,
--- returns `nil, error`. (Errors usually only happen on value types incompatible
--- with JSON.)
---
--- The argument value uses similar conventions as `mp.set_property_native()` to
--- distinguish empty objects and arrays.
function utils.format_json(v) end

--- Turn the given value into a string. Formats tables and their contents. This
--- doesn't do anything special; it is only needed because Lua is terrible.
function utils.to_string(v) end
