local input = {}

--- Show the console to let the user enter text.
---
--- The following entries of `table` are read:
---
--- - `prompt`: The string to be displayed before the input field.
--- - `submit`: A callback invoked when the user presses Enter. The first argument
---   is the text in the console.
--- - `keep_open`: Whether to keep the console open on submit. Defaults to `false`.
--- - `opened`: A callback invoked when the console is shown. This can be used to
---   present a list of options with `input.set_log()`.
--- - `edited`: A callback invoked when the text changes. The first argument is the
---   text in the console.
--- - `complete`: A callback invoked when the user edits the text or moves the
---   cursor. The first argument is the text before the cursor. The callback should
---   return a table of the string candidate completion values and the 1-based
---   cursor position from which the completion starts. console will show the
---   completions that fuzzily match the text between this position and the cursor
---   and allow selecting them. The third and optional return value is a string that
---   will be appended to the input line without displaying it in the completions.
--- - `autoselect_completion`: Whether to automatically select the first completion
---   on submit if one wasn't already manually selected. Defaults to `false`.
--- - `closed`: A callback invoked when the console is hidden, either because
---   `input.terminate()` was invoked from the other callbacks, or because the user
---   closed it with a key binding. The first argument is the text in the console,
---   and the second argument is the cursor position.
--- - `default_text`: A string to pre-fill the input field with.
--- - `cursor_position`: The initial cursor position, starting from 1.
--- - `history_path`: If specified, the path to save and load the history of the
---   entered lines.
--- - `id`: An identifier that determines which input history and log buffer to use
---   among the ones stored for `input.get()` calls. Defaults to the calling script
---   name with `prompt` appended.
function input.get(table) end

--- Close the console.
function input.terminate() end

--- Add a line to the log buffer. `style` can contain additional ASS tags to apply
--- to `message`, and `terminal_style` can contain escape sequences that are used
--- when the console is displayed in the terminal.
function input.log(message, style, terminal_style) end

--- Helper to add a line to the log buffer with the same color as the one used for
--- commands that error. Useful when the user submits invalid input.
function input.log_error(message) end

--- Replace the entire log buffer.
---
--- `log` is a table of strings, or tables with `text`, `style` and `terminal_style`
--- keys.
---
--- Example:
---
--- ```
--- input.set_log({
---     "regular text",
---     {
---         text = "error text",
---         style = "{\\c&H7a77f2&}",
---         terminal_style = "\027[31m",
---     }
--- })
--- ```
function input.set_log(log) end

--- Specify a list of items that are presented to the user for selection.
---
--- The following entries of `table` are read:
---
--- - `prompt`: The string to be displayed before the input field.
--- - `items`: The table of the entries to choose from.
--- - `default_item`: The 1-based integer index of the preselected item.
--- - `submit`: The callback invoked when the user presses Enter. The first argument
---   is the 1-based index of the selected item.
--- - `keep_open`: Whether to keep the console open on submit. Defaults to `false`.
---
--- Example:
---
--- ```
--- input.select({
---     items = {
---         "First playlist entry",
---         "Second playlist entry",
---     },
---     submit = function (id)
---         mp.commandv("playlist-play-index", id - 1)
---     end,
--- })
--- ```
function input.select(table) end

return input
